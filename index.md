### Introduction
Social vulnerability, according to CDC, refers to "the potential negative effects on communities caused by external stresses on human health. Such stresses include natural or human-caused disasters, or disease outbreaks. Reducing social vulnerability can decrease both human suffering and economic loss." 

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has since 2000 irregularly published a **CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)** for all counties in the US, measuring 15 U.S. census variables to help local officials identify communities that may need support before, during, or after disasters. The last SVI was published in 2018.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, federal and local governments have to predict/respond with data, given the 2018 SVI, it might be used as one of the metrics to help government officials to decide where the assistance might be prioritized.

In this project in particular, I wish to answer the follow questions:
1. What are the characteristics of the 5% most vulnerable counties as ranked by the SVI?
  + Answer by Data Visualization
2. from question 1, how different are the counties compared to the median county?
  + Answer by Data Visualization
3. To what extent the social vulnerability is related to COVID transmission on county level?
  + Answer by Regression Model
